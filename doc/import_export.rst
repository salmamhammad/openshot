Import & Export
===============

Video editing projects (including tracks, clips, and keyframes) can be **imported** and **exported** from OpenShot
Video Editor in widely supported formats (**EDL**: Edit Decision Lists, and **XML**: Final Cut Pro format). For example, if
you start editing a video in a different program (Adobe Premier, Final Cut Pro, etc...), but later need to move all
your edits to OpenShot (or vice versa).

EDL (Edit Decision Lists)

   Edits                 All clips on all tracks are supported (video, image, and audio files). Transitions are not yet supported.
